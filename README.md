Gels+
========

Just playing around making the gels from Portal 2 for fun.

----------

# How to compile #

1. Download and install JDK and Gradle
 * There is an excellent tutorial on how to do this on equivalent exchange 3 github page. see [here for java](https://github.com/pahimar/equivalent-exchange-3#setup-java) and [here for gradle](https://github.com/pahimar/equivalent-exchange-3#setup-gradle).
2. Download the source. It is recommended you use `git clone https://github.com/Lomeli12/GelsPlus` to download.
3. Go into the folder where you have downloaded the source.
4. Run `gradle build`.
5. Compiled jar should be in *build/libs*.
